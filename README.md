# Blank-PNG-Generator

This repository was created because I wanted test images to test NFT generation algorithms but didn't have different blank images to test it.

## Usage
Run the "generate_test_images.py" script for the folders and images to be generated. If you want to rename the folders, change the parts of the script where these path strings pop up.
```python
os.mkdir(f'test_images/row_{x+1}')
```
